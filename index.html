    Below is my second section from the nav where i did the same thing using a div container with the class "about-me" to design the box however with some adjustments to the text-align to better fit the pictures I added 
    -->

    <section id="About-Me">
      <div class="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I used to work at a prop warehouse making prop weapons for movies and television. While there I contributed to shows like 'The Terminal List' and movies like 'Renfield'.
        </p>
        <p>Although I loved my job I wanted to try something new and becoming a Software Engineer seemed like a great fit for me. It is something I have always found fascinating and goes well with other interests I have. Some of those interests include...
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Gaming
            <ul>
              <li>I have always played games since I was young and always wanted my life to have something to do with them originally I thought that would be through art</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Computers
              <ul>
              <li>My love of games eventually led me to building my own computer which I found to be super fulfilling and I still love to learn about the newest computer parts and trends.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Travel
            <ul>
              <li>Moving from Canada to America when I was young as well as, having two parents who would occasionally travel to different countries for work greatly influneced my love for traveling today.</li>
              <li>After graduating High School in 2019 I travelled through Europe with friends as well as many other graduating students from lots of schools</li>
              <li>My most recent trip was traveling to visit my friend and his brother in Tokyo, Japan</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
